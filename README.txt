This is some basic Julia code for simple discrete probability table
manipulation.

This code was developed for Julia version 0.5.0

To run the demos (see the Demos folder):
start julia and then from within julia type:
julia> cd("directory where this README file is")
julia> include("setup.jl")
julia> using brml
julia> demoBurglar()
julia> demoHMMInferenceSimple()

and similarly for the other demos.
